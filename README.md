# Rusty docs

A simple documentation generator for Python code. This is meant to be a tool
that generates markdown files from docstrings in your code. It is been designed
to be used by [Strawberry GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks)'s source code, so
it might not be the best tool for your use case. However, if you are interested
in using it, feel free to open an issue or a PR!
