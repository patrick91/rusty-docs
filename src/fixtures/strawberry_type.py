    """Annotates a class as a GraphQL type.

    You can use it like this:

    >>> @strawberry.type:
    >>> class X:
    >>>     field_abc: str = "ABC"

    Or like this:

    >>> @strawberry.type(name="GraphQLName"):
    >>> class X:
    >>>     field_abc: str = "ABC"

    Arguments:
        cls: the class you want to wrap
        name:
            an optional name, this will be used in the GraphQL schema
        description:
            an optional description, this will be used in the GraphQL schema
        directives:
            a Sequence of schema directives, this will be outputted in the schema
            when printing it.
        extend:
            if set to True, the type will be marked as an extension type.
            This is only used for Apollo Federation at the moment.

    Private arguments:
        is_input:
            a flag to indicate if the type is an input type
        is_interface:
            a flag to indicate if the type is an interface


    Returns:
        A decorated version of the passed class, which can be used anywhere you
        need to use GraphQL types.
